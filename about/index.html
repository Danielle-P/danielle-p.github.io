    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Danielle, a product designer with a background in law. After my degree, I worked in banking law before
      making a career change and re-training as a UX Designer via a graduate scheme. I’ve since gained 7 years
      experience in Product Design and have worked on a variety of platforms in that time, including an iOS app which I
      co-created, alongside gaining some experience in front-end development.</p>
    <p>My design approach focuses on creating intuitive and elegant experiences that solve real problems and pains for
      users. I am able to apply the problem-solving and analytical skills I developed in my legal training to develop a
      deep understanding of users and deliver value to customers. I love working on designs that remove friction and
      make people’s day-to-day lives easier. I am happiest when I am able to also spend some time on the small details,
      which I believe can help transform a good experience into a delightful one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy working closely with PMs, engineers and data teams to collaborate on my designs as I believe the
      diversity of
      thought that comes from working as a cross-functional team is the best way to solve users' problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work I have completed a number of <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a> including co-founding and
      designing the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mealsup/id1200169378">MealsUp iOS App</a>, a
      meal-scheduling App which has over 15,000 users globally and a rating of 4.7 stars on the App Store. I was solely
      responsible for the visual and UX design of MealsUp.
    </p>

    <p>In my spare time I love running, hiking in the mountains and travelling. I’m currently based in Barcelona.</p>
