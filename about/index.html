    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I have over 4 years' experience in UX design and front-end development. In my current role as Senior UX Designer
      at KPMG I design and deliver ‘voice of the customer’ dashboard solutions to help businesses understand their
      customer needs and pain points, to leverage their customer satisfaction data to drive organisational change and
      improve their customers’ experience.</p>

    <p>My design approach focuses heavily on understanding the user’s needs, business context and goals. I am able to
      apply the problem-solving and analytical skills I developed in my previous legal training to create designs which
      provide solutions to user problems and deliver value to our clients’ businesses. My experience in front-end coding
      also informs my design process, enabling me to create component-based designs which are feasible and can be
      implemented within project timelines. I enjoy working with developers to implement my designs and solve any
      problems
      that arise during the build phase.
    </p>

    <p>I currently work with product and engineering teams to design the UX and UI of features, new components and
      modules for
      our core dashboard product. The product itself is highly customisable and I am responsible for the UX design
      and
      the front-end build of bespoke implementations of the product for our clients. Our client implementations include
      household-name brands in the energy, airline and
      financial sectors and have over 40,000 unique logins per month.
    </p>

    <p>Outside of work I have completed a number of <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a> including co-founding
      and
      designing the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mealsup/id1200169378">MealsUp iOS App</a>,
      a meal-scheduling App which has over 14,000 users globally and a rating of 4.7 stars on
      the App Store. I was solely responsible for the visual and UX design of MealsUp.</p>
