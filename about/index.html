  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>In my role as Senior UX Designer at KPMG, I work within the Customer Experience Cloud (CX Cloud) team. CX Cloud is
    a ‘voice of the customer’ dashboard solution designed to provide management and insight professionals with an
    understanding of their customer needs and pain points in order to drive organisational change and improvements in
    their customers’ experience. The product itself is highly customisable and I am responsible for the UX design and
    the front-end build of the dashboards which are designed and implemented on a client-by-client basis.</p>

  <p>I have worked most recently with household-name brands in the energy, airline and financial sectors to deliver a
    variety of solutions to help those businesses use their customer experience data to measure and drive improvements
    in performance.</p>

  <p>Outside of work I have completed a number of <a href="/portfolio/index.html">projects</a> including co-founding and
    designing the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mealsup/id1200169378">MealsUp iOS App</a>. MealsUp is
    designed to be a simple, easy to use meal-scheduling App with additional features such as a groceries list
    automatically generated upon scheduling a meal. As part of the two
    person team that created the App, I was solely responsible for the visual and UX design. MealsUp has over 9,000
    users and currently has a rating of 4.6 stars on the App Store.</p>

    <p class="slide-in">After the completion of my Law degree and LPC, I became a Legal Executive in the field of
      Banking and Financial Services Law in 2011. I initially worked for Squire Patton Boggs, a large international
      law
      firm, and then moved
      on to the Yorkshire-based firm Gordons LLP in 2013.</p>

    <p class="slide-in">During my time as a Legal Executive I progressed from working as part of a team of seven on
      banking and financial
      services transactions to managing my own caseload of corporate property finance transactions.</p>

    <p class="slide-in">At both Squire Patton Boggs and Gordons I was part of a team which often had a large workload.
      I
      was able to
      efficiently prioritise my various roles, completing individual tasks by set deadlines and also assisting the
      team
      with collective projects.</p>

    <p class="slide-in">My experience in Banking Law helped me to build on my ability to work in a high pressure
      environment and use my

    <p class="slide-in">I joined the KPMG TechSolutions graduate scheme in October 2015. My career change from law
      into
      the technology
      sector was driven by my ambition to work in a less prescriptive and more creative industry with greater
      opportunity for learning and growth.</p>

    <p class="slide-in">My previous qualifications and experience meant I was able to bring to this role, and my
      future
      roles in this
      sector, sophisticated analytical and commercial reasoning skills.</p>

    <p class="slide-in">I initially joined the KPMG Learning Academy as an Instructional Designer where I gained
      valuable experience in designing for learning and was introduced to the basic principles of design. This role
      included:</p>

    <ul class="slide-in">
      <li>Liaising with stakeholders on the subject matter of online courses.</li>
      <li>Writing content for online courses.</li>

    <p class="slide-in">In February 2015 I moved to the KPMG Nunwood team to train as a UX Designer, working with the
      team that designs
      and builds the Customer Experience Cloud (CX Cloud) product. In this role I was able to rapidly expand my design
      skills and gained valuable experience in:</p>

    <ul class="slide-in">
      <li>Designing for data visualisation.</li>
      <li>Micro-interaction design.</li>
      <li>Infographic design.</li>
      <li>Designing mock-ups and interactive wireframes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="slide-in">As a UX designer I also trained in front-end development, including:</p>

    <ul class="slide-in">
      <li>HTML and Bootstrap</li>
      <li>CSS (primarily using LESS)</li>
      <li>jQuery and basic JavaScript</li>
      <li>Using razor templates, C# and the Highcharts library to create data visualisations</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="slide-in">I was promoted to Senior UX Designer in 2018. As a Senior UX Designer my role entails acting
      as
      the UX Lead and
      front-end developer on client projects alongside contributing to the design of elements of the CX Cloud product.
      My key responsibilities include:</p>

    <ul class="slide-in">
      <li>Acting as a UX client contact on projects throughout the design and build phase as well as during the BAU
        phase.</li>
      <li>Requirements gathering from clients at scoping sessions.</li>
      <li>Creating initial designs through to interactive wireframes for client dashboard solutions.</li>
      <li>Building the front-end and user interactions for client dashboards.</li>
      <li>Delegating and coordinating front-end build tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="slide-in">During my time at KPMG Nunwood I have designed and built a number of long-term, successful
      client dashboards
      which are used by up to 1,000 users each month.</p>
