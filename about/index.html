  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I have over 4 years' experience in UX design and front-end development. In my current role as Senior UX Designer at
    KPMG I work within the
    Customer Experience Cloud team to design and deliver
    ‘voice of the customer’ dashboard solutions. These provide management and insight professionals with an
    understanding of their customer needs and pain points in order to drive organisational change and improvements in
    their customers’ experience. I work with the product and
    engineering teams to design the UX and UI of features,
    new components and modules for the core product. The product itself is highly customisable and I am responsible for
    the UX design and
    the front-end build of the bespoke implementation of dashboard solutions, which are designed and built on a
    client-by-client basis.</p>

  <p>I have worked most recently with household-name brands in the energy, airline and financial sectors (including
    easyJet, British Gas and Yorkshire Building Society) to deliver a
    variety of solutions to help those businesses use their customer experience data to measure and drive improvements
    in performance.</p>

  <p>Outside of work I have completed a number of <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a> including co-founding and
    designing the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mealsup/id1200169378">MealsUp iOS App</a>,
    a meal-scheduling App which has over 14,000 users around the world and a rating of 4.7 stars on
    the App Store. I was solely responsible for the visual and UX design of MealsUp.</p>
