    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>I’m a product designer with 10 years of professional experience. My background was originally in law, and I moved
      into product design via a technical graduate scheme at KPMG. Since then, I’ve worked across early-stage start-ups
      and larger enterprises on products ranging from a <a href="/projects/qa-platform.html">B2B SaaS app</a> for
      engineers, a <a href="/projects/vaayu.html">carbon-emissions tracking tool</a>
      for retailers, as well as <a href="/projects/dashboard-design.html">multiple dashboards</a> for enterprise
      clients. I’ve also worked on successful side projects, including a <a href="/projects/mealsup.html">meal-planning
        iOS app</a> and a 'choose
      your own adventure’ style <a href="/projects/adventure-gen.html">game</a> using AI.
    </p>

    <p>I have an interest in both technical design and front-end coding, with around 5 years’ experience building the
      front-end for customer-facing dashboards, including data visualisations, at KPMG. I enjoy the balance of design and
      technical work — a thread that runs through my career
      from my split coding/design role to later roles collaborating closely with engineers to create design both
      for technical software to improve workflows and no-code tools.
    </p>

    <p>As a designer, I’m motivated by variety and the opportunity to learn about complex problems or topics, from
      simplifying complex
      workflows to learning about the technical aspects of carbon emissions data and climate
      change. Whatever the problem or subject matter, my priority is always the end user and working across teams to
      ensure that
      the end designs distil complexity into
      something intuitive and effortless to use.</p>
