    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I have 5 years' experience in Product & UX design and front-end development. My design approach focuses heavily
      on
      understanding the users' needs, the business context and goals. I am able to
      apply the problem-solving and analytical skills I developed in my previous legal training to create designs which
      provide solutions to user problems and deliver value to our clientsâ€™ businesses. My experience in front-end coding
      also informs my design process, enabling me to create component-based designs which are feasible and can be
      implemented within project timelines. I enjoy working with engineers to implement my designs and solve any
      problems
      that arise during the build phase. I am currently working as a Product Designer at Global App Testing where I work
      closely with
      product owners and engineers.
    </p>

    <p>Outside of work I have completed a number of <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a> including co-founding
      and
      designing the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mealsup/id1200169378">MealsUp iOS App</a>,
      a meal-scheduling App which has over 14,000 users globally and a rating of 4.7 stars on
      the App Store. I was solely responsible for the visual and UX design of MealsUp.</p>
