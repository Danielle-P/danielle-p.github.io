  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I have over 4 years' experience in UX design and front-end development. In my current role as Senior UX Designer at
    KPMG I work within the
    Customer Experience Cloud team to design and deliver
    ‘voice of the customer’ dashboard solutions. These provide management and insight professionals with an
    understanding of their customer needs and pain points in order to drive organisational change and improvements in
    their customers’ experience. The product itself is highly customisable and I am responsible for the UX design and
    the front-end build of the dashboards, which are designed and implemented on a client-by-client basis.</p>

  <p>I have worked most recently with household-name brands in the energy, airline and financial sectors to deliver a
    variety of solutions to help those businesses use their customer experience data to measure and drive improvements
    in performance.</p>

  <p>Outside of work I have completed a number of <a href="/portfolio/index.html">projects</a> including co-founding and
    designing the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mealsup/id1200169378">MealsUp iOS App</a>,
    a meal-scheduling App which has over 9,000 users around the world and a rating of 4.7 stars on
    the App Store. I was solely responsible for the visual and UX design of MealsUp.</p>
