    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>I’m a product designer with over 8 years' professional experience. My background was originally in law, and I
      made
      the
      career change to product design via a technical graduate scheme at KPMG. During my design career I’ve gained a
      wide
      range of experience, working for both early stage start-ups and larger enterprises on a range of products
      including a
      <a href="/projects/qa-platform.html">B2B SaaS app</a> for engineers, a <a
        href="/projects/vaayu.html">carbon-emissions tracking tool</a> for retailers, and <a
        href="/projects/dashboard-design.html"> dashboards</a> for enterprise
      customers. I have also worked on successful side projects, such as a <a
        href="/projects/mealsup.html">meal-planning iOS app</a> and a 'choose
      your own
      adventure’ style <a href="/projects/adventure-gen.html">game</a> using AI.
    </p>

    <p>I also have previous experience and a strong interest in front-end coding, with around 5 years’
      experience in
      building the front end for customer-facing dashboard applications, including data visualisations. I enjoy the
      balance of design and
      more
      technical topics; this has been a strand throughout my career beginning with my split coding/design role at KPMG
      and
      continuing in later roles where I worked closely with engineers to design software to help improve engineers’
      workflows.</p>

    <p>In terms of my motivations as a designer, I enjoy roles where there is a lot of variety and the opportunity to
      learn
      about complex problems or topics, whether this be exploring how to take the pain out of complex workflows or (as
      in my
      most recent role) learning about the more technical aspects of carbon emissions data and climate change. Whatever
      the
      problem or subject matter, my priority is always the end user and ensuring that my designs distil complexity into
      something intuitive that can be used effortlessly.</p>
