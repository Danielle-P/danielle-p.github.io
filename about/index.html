    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Danielle. My background is originally in law and, after 5 years of working in banking law, I made the
      switch to UX design through a graduate
      scheme and have been working as a product/UX designer for the last 7 years.</p>
    <p>My design approach focuses on creating intuitive and elegant experiences that solve real problems and deliver
      customer value. I am able to
      apply the problem-solving and analytical skills I developed in my legal training to develop a deep understanding
      of users and deliver value to customers. I have worked on a variety of
      digital products, including B2B dashboards, SaaS platforms and iOS
      apps.

      I also have experience in front-end coding - this informs my design process and helps me to work effectively with
      engineers. I enjoy working with engineers early on in my design process as I believe working as a cross-functional
      team, and the diversity of
      thought that brings, is the best way to solve
      users' problems.
    </p>

    <p>Outside of work I have completed a number of <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a> including co-founding
      and
      designing the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mealsup/id1200169378">MealsUp iOS App</a>,
      a meal-scheduling App which has over 15,000 users globally and a rating of 4.7 stars on
      the App Store. I was solely responsible for the visual and UX design of MealsUp.</p>

    <p>Aside from design I love running, hiking in the mountains and travelling. </p>
