  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am a Senior UX Designer at KPMG, working closely with a small team to design and implement bespoke client
    dashboards visualising customer experience and satisfaction data. The dashboards I design and create are based on a
    product developed over a number of years, but the design and front-end build of the produc is bespoke to each of our
    clients. My role is twofold - to lead on the design of the client implementation of the dashboard, including
    requirements gathering, meeting with clients at scoping sessions and creating the wireframe; 2) building the front
    end of the site, which also includes writing the code for data visualisations in razor.
  </p>

  <p>I have worked with household name clients in the Energy, Banking and Airline sectors</p>

  <!-- In my role as Senior UX Designer at KPMG, I work on designing and
  building bespoke Customer Experience Dashboards which are used
  internally by our clients to analyse customer experience and
  satisfaction data taken from surveys. I have worked most recently with
  household-name brands in the financial, airline and energy sectors to
  deliver a variety of solutions to help those businesses measure
  performance through customer experience data. -->
  <p>
    Outside of work I am part of the two-person team that created the app
    MealsUp, which is available on the App Store. MealsUp is designed to be
    a simple, easy to use meal scheduling app with additional features
    including a groceries list automatically generated upon scheduling a
    meal and a method feature which allows users to follow a specific recipe
    whilst cooking.
