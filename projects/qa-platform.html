    <p>I worked as a Product Designer at Global App Testing, a start-up which offers crowd-sourced QA
      testing. As part of a cross-functional team I helped design their new
      SaaS platform from scratch, which was taken to market during my time there. The platform allowed customers to test
      their apps
      on demand by launching tests themselves from our UI
      to our crowd of QA testers. Customers can then receive results within the
      platform, which they can review and export to their bug-tracking tools.</p>
    <p>My role in this project included working closely with
      the product
      manager
      to conduct research in order to better
      understand and analyse user pain points and problems, and using this research data to create and iterate on an MVP
      based on quantitative data.</p>
    <p>Here is a case study of one of the post-MVP projects I worked on.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>After the creation of the MVP, we heard from customers that one of the pain points experienced in the QA
          process was the time it takes customers to triage issues (bugs) found within their apps. We knew this
          was
          an
          important
          problem area
          to focus on because our research showed QA teams were often under-resourced and experienced a lot of time
          pressure, so this pain point exacerbated wider problems in QA.</p>
        <p>Our hypothesis was that making it quicker and easier for QA teams to triage issues found by our testers
          would help our
          customers to process and fix
          those issues, and therefore allow for quicker releases.</p>

    <h2>Project Objective & My Role</h2>
    <p>The objective of the project was to facilitate an effective triage process by implementing a simple issue
      workflow to:
    <ul>
      <li>Enable an easy and quick triage flow within our platform</li>
      <li>Hide rejected issues from the main issues view</li>
      <li>Make the triaging process highly visible to help team communication</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We also wanted to track the issue acceptance rate to monitor both the issue reporting quality and the
      adoption
      of the triaging functionality.</p>
    <p>My role was to lead the design of this project. I worked with the Product Manager in the discovery phase
      from the beginning, speaking to customers to ascertain the most important pain points in their triaging
      process.
      I collaborated with the Product Manager and Tech Lead to design the first iteration of the solution, which
      included workshopping ideas and creating concept
      mock-ups through to clickable prototypes. I
      tested wireframes and prototypes with customers before finalising the designs. Having monitored the data and
      usage of the feature, I then identified improvements that could be made in the second iteration of the
      design.

      <h2>Main Customer Pain Points</h2>
      <p>After interviewing customers, target customers and non-customers in the QA space, we identified a number of

            <p>Invalid issues mean we spend a lot of time triaging results</p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>The way we were showing issues found by testers to our customers did not
      include any
      triaging functionality. We knew the result of this was that customers were spending up to 4 times as long
      triaging their
      results as they would like.
      We also knew what the main pain points were around triaging issues and we had a good understanding of the
      context and understood the risks and negative consequences of a bad
      triaging flow.
      In light of this, the Product Manager and Tech Lead and I workshopped: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What might be the simplest way to introduce a triaging workflow so that we can speed up the triaging
        time?</li>
      <li>Can we achieve this using the existing issues page view?</li>
      <li>Can we create an intuitive and easy-to-use triaging flow within the current technical constraints?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>After a couple of rounds of brainstorming and voting on ideas, we decided that an accept/reject button
      for each issue would be a quick way to solve
      the customers' problems - it would allow them to hide rejected issues, communicate the triage status of
      issues
      to others in their team and be a first step towards enabling better issue triaging.</p>
    <p>This was a change that could be made reasonably quickly in the code, however we were concerned that it
      would cause problems if we introduced it within the existing design, which showed the issues
      in an expandable accordion view. Adding the option to accept/reject issues within this already
      information-heavy view would cause various problems which might actually slow down the triaging process
      and be detrimental to the user experience.</p>
    <p>After exploring some potential solutions within the existing view, we realised it would be better to
      change the structure of the
      page to allow us to better solve the problem for the customer. The options we had within the existing page
      did not effectively solve the customers problem, so we decided to move away from the accordion view and
      show each issue in its own page. The next step was to scope
      out
      this work with the full engineering team so that we could gain an understanding of how much more work this
      would be to
      implement.</p>

      <h2>Design Phase</h2>
      <p>After fully defining the problem and working through the technical constraints with the engineers, we
        defined the requirements for the first iteration of the triage flow as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The layout will be restructured so that each issue is shown on an individual page</li>
        <li>The issues list should be filterable so that users can avoid seeing the 'noise' of rejected
          issues, making it easier for them to focus only on the valid issues</li>
        <li>Accept/reject buttons need to be highly visible, easy to click, and it needs to be clear to users what
          these terms mean - we need to test this with users</li>
        <li>Ideally, users could easily navigate to the next issue in the list within an individual issue view to
          speed
          up
          the triage flow</li>
        <li>The reason for rejecting a issue should be shown in the UI. We can use the data we have on tag usage to
          find out the
          most common reasons a issue is not valid</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We also had the following constraints:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use components within the existing design system to help speed up implementation</li>
        <li>Layout changes for the issue information should be kept to a minimum to keep the migration of issues to
          a
          separate page simple to implement</li>
        <li>Allowing the user to navigate back to a previous issue is out of scope due to complexity</li>

          following:</p>

          <li>70.9% of all tests run included at least some issue triaging</li>
          <li>Customers who launched the most tests had the highest adoption rates</li>
          <li>Most rejected issues were for the reasons 'as designed' and 'duplicate'</li>

    <h2>Reflections & Further Iterations</h2>
    <p>The data and feedback from our customers showed that some improvements could be made to the triage flow to
      make the triage process even quicker and easier, and to further increase adoption rates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accept and reject buttons could still be more obvious (this came from customer feedback and also from
        viewing HotJar recordings)</li>
      <li>The 'next issue' button needs to be more prominent</li>
      <li>Layout improvements would create better visual hierarchy</li>
      <li>Showing number of issues remaining in the 'not triaged' lists would help users understand how far
        through the triaging process they are</li>
      <li>Disabling the export button unless an issue is accepted may improve adoption rate and prevent exports of
        rejected issues in error</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is my updated design which addresses some of the above points. As this was a recent project, I have
      not yet been
      able to monitor the impact of the new design as we do not currently have enough customer data.</p>
