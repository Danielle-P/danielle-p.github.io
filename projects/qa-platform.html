    <p>As a product designer at Global App Testing, a start-up which offers crowd-sourced QA
      testing, I have worked in a
      cross-functional
      team to design and build a new
      SaaS platform from scratch, which was taken to market during my time there. The platform allowed customers to test
      their apps
      on demand by launching tests themselves from our UI
      to our crowd of QA testers. Customers receive results within the
      platform, which they could review and export to their bug-tracking tools.</p>
    <p>My role in this project included working closely with
      the product
      manager
      to conduct research in order to better
      understand and analyse user pain points and problems, and using this research data to create and iterate on an MVP
      based on quantitative data.</p>
    <p>Here is a case study of one of the post-MVP projects I worked on.</p>

            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>After the creation of the MVP, we heard from customers that one of the pain points experienced in the QA
              process was the time it takes customers to triage issues (bugs) found within their apps. We knew this
              was
              an
              important
              problem area
              to focus on because our research showed QA teams were often under-resourced and experienced a lot of time
              pressure, so this pain point exacerbated wider problems in QA.</p>
            <p>Our hypothesis was that making it quicker and easier for QA teams to triage issues found by our testers
              would help our
              customers to process and fix
              those issues, and therefore allow for quicker releases.</p>

          <h4>Project Objective & My Role</h4>
          <p>The objective of the project was to facilitate an effective triage process by implementing a simple issue
            workflow to:
          <ul>
            <li>Enable an easy and quick triage flow within our platform</li>
            <li>Hide rejected issues from the main issues view</li>
            <li>Make the triaging process highly visible to help team communication</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>We also wanted to track the issue acceptance rate to monitor both the issue reporting quality and the
            adoption
            of the triaging functionality.</p>
          <p>My role was to lead the design of this project. I worked with the Product Manager in the discovery phase
            from the beginning, speaking to customers to ascertain the most important pain points in their triaging
            process.
            I collaborated with the Product Manager and Tech Lead to design the first iteration of the solution, which
            included workshopping ideas and creating concept
            mock-ups through to clickable prototypes. I
            tested wireframes and prototypes with customers before finalising the designs. Having monitored the data and
            usage of the feature, I then identified improvements that could be made in the second iteration of the
            design.

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <div class="page-content-width">
            <p>The way we were showing issues found by testers to our customers did not
              include any
              triaging functionality. We knew the result of this was that customers were spending up to 4 times as long
              triaging their
              results as they would like.
              We also knew what the main pain points were around triaging issues and we had a good understanding of the
              context and understood the risks and negative consequences of a bad
              triaging flow.
              In light of this, the Product Manager and Tech Lead and I workshopped: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What might be the simplest way to introduce a triaging workflow so that we can speed up the triaging
                time?</li>
              <li>Can we achieve this using the existing issues page view?</li>
              <li>Can we create an intuitive and easy-to-use triaging flow within the current technical constraints?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>After a couple of rounds of brainstorming and voting on ideas, we decided that an accept/reject button
              for each issue would be a quick way to solve
              the customers' problems - it would allow them to hide rejected issues, communicate the triage status of
              issues
              to others in their team and be a first step towards enabling better issue triaging.</p>
            <p>This was a change that could be made reasonably quickly in the code, however we were concerned that it
              would cause problems if we introduced it within the existing design, which showed the issues
              in an expandable accordion view. Adding the option to accept/reject issues within this already
              information-heavy view would cause various problems which might actually slow down the triaging process
              and be detrimental to the user experience.</p>
            <p>After exploring some potential solutions within the existing view, we realised it would be better to
              change the structure of the
              page to allow us to better solve the problem for the customer. The options we had within the existing page
              did not effectively solve the customers problem, so we decided to move away from the accordion view and
              show each issue in its own page. The next step was to scope
              out
              this work with the full engineering team so that we could gain an understanding of how much more work this
              would be to
              implement.</p>

          <p>After fully defining the problem and working through the technical constraints with the engineers, we
            defined the requirements for the first iteration of the triage flow as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The layout will be restructured so that each issue is shown on an individual page</li>
            <li>The issues list should be filterable so that users can avoid seeing the 'noise' of rejected
              issues, making it easier for them to focus only on the valid issues</li>
            <li>Accept/reject buttons need to be highly visible, easy to click, and it needs to be clear to users what
              these terms mean - we need to test this with users</li>
            <li>Ideally, users could easily navigate to the next issue in the list within an individual issue view to
              speed
              up
              the triage flow</li>
            <li>The reason for rejecting a issue should be shown in the UI. We can use the data we have on tag usage to
              find out the
              most common reasons a issue is not valid</li>

            <li>Use components within the existing design system to help speed up implementation</li>
            <li>Layout changes for the issue information should be kept to a minimum to keep the migration of issues to
              a
              separate page simple to implement</li>

          <h3>Reflections & Further Iterations</h3>
          <p>The data and feedback from our customers showed that some improvements could be made to the triage flow to
            make the triage process even quicker and easier, and to further increase adoption rates:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accept and reject buttons could still be more obvious (this came from customer feedback and also from
              viewing HotJar recordings)</li>
            <li>The 'next issue' button needs to be more prominent</li>
            <li>Layout improvements would create better visual hierarchy</li>
            <li>Showing number of issues remaining in the 'not triaged' lists would help users understand how far
              through the triaging process they are</li>
            <li>Disabling the export button unless an issue is accepted may improve adoption rate and prevent exports of
              rejected issues in error</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here is my updated design which addresses some of the above points. As this was a recent project, I have
            not yet been
