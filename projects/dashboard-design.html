      <p>In my role at KPMG, I designed B2B ‘voice of the customer’ dashboard solutions
        which help
        insight experts and managers analyse complex data to understand customer satisfaction levels and pain points.
      </p>
      <p>I worked with the
        product owner and the development team lead to develop the UX and
        visual design of features and components for the core product. The product is highly customisable and I also
        worked as the UX lead on projects to
        design and code the front-end for bespoke
        client implementations of the product.</p>
      <p>Due to client confidentiality I'm unable to share specific client details so the designs
        have been anonymised.</p>

            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>Our client was in the airline industry and was struggling to gain in-depth insight into their customer
              journeys and satisfaction levels
              using their existing insights dashboard. Their existing dashboard was too simplistic and did not meet the
              needs of the many different user groups - users were not able to drill-down into the data to get the
              information they needed, nor did the dashboard provide a sufficient overview for users who needed a
              high-level snapshot of their team's performance.</p>
            <p>We designed and built a new dashboard from scratch, focusing on addressing the differing needs of each
              user group.</p>

          <h4>My Role</h4>
          <p>As the UX/UI lead for the project I was responsible for the UX and UI design of the site, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Collaborating with the client at scoping sessions to translate different user group requirements into
              usable designs</li>
            <li>Working with the data and insight teams to map the information architecture</li>
            <li>Leading the end-to-end design phase</li>
            <li>Building the front-end of the site and co-ordinating build tasks with the data team</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Project Challenges & Outcomes</h4>
          <p>The main challenge on this project was designing for so many different user groups, each with varying
            requirements. To overcome this challenge, we mapped out different user flows and created unique sets of
            pages for each user group. User access to these pages would be controlled in
            the dashboard by assigned user roles and permissions. We consulted with representatives from the different
            user groups at the prototyping stage, gathering feedback as part of the iterative design process to ensure
            the needs of each user group were met.</p>
          <p>The resulting dashboard included bespoke pages for five different user groups. In the second phase of
            development we added further sets of bespoke pages for 3 more user groups.</p>

          <p>Using the user stories, I tailored pages to each user group with simple score-based views for the
            cabin/in-flight
            and
            on-the-ground users who needed to be able to quickly identify their performance against their targets
            whilst
            they were on the move, including how their scores compared with other teams and performance of their
            individual team members.</p>
          <p>The Head Office and management level scores page designs were more complex, showing more
            detailed
            analytics and including the functionality for those users to see a high level overview with the option to
            drill down further into the data by clicking on links to view trended data, or clicking directly on
            metrics to view further data.
          </p>
          <p>Around half of users in the user groups we identified would be accessing the site only on mobile devices
            as
            they were not office-based. I created mockups and wireframes for both mobile and desktop depending on the
            user group I was designing for, and sought and acted upon feedback from the relevant stakeholders before
            creating the final prototypes using Sketch and InVision.</p>

          <h3>Reflections</h3>
          <p>The design phase for this project was very lengthy due to there being a number of different sets of
            pages, each of which we received user feedback on. As a result it became quite difficult to manage the
            feedback in InVision, the prototyping tool we were using, as there were a number of different users adding
            comments to the pages relevant to them on the prototype. I gained good experience on this project
            in managing that user feedback, with the key learning points being to set a hard deadline for receiving the
            feedback
            and
            to
            collate the feedback before acting on any of it. This makes the process much more manageable in terms of
            both
            reviewing the feedback efficiently in one session and identifying common themes in order to prioritise if
            and how
            feedback points should
            be actioned.</p>
          <p>In terms of the project output, the client has seen a large increase in the number of users logging
            on to their dashboard to monitor their scores compared to the number of logins on their previous dashboard.
            User feedback since launch has been very positive, with the dashboard extended to a number of additional
            user groups who requested similar designs and functionality to the existing pages.</p>

            Qualitative user feedback indicated that users found this grid difficult to filter and search, making
            it
            difficult to find reports they had previously created. I focused on creating a more visual, clean UI
            with
            a
            clear and
            intuitive search and filter component.</p>

            <p>In the re-design, I moved towards a more visual, tile-based approach where users would be able to
              see
              a
              thumbnail of
              the previously saved report so they would not have to rely on remembering the name of the report to find
              it
              again. I also incorporated slide-out panels into the design to allow users to easily filter and search for
              reports and I added tag functionality to allow users to tag reports so that they could view selections of
              reports on similar metrics.</p>
            <p>
              As the user flow for the reporting component is quite complex, I simplified the options available to the
              user
              by
              designing each report tile to be interactive, with a list of options (edit, view, share etc.) available on
              hover.</p>
            <p>My main aim with this re-design was to make the reporting page less overwhelming for the user, more
              intuitive
              and visually appealing. Showing only 6 reports at a time encourages the user to filter the reports by tags
              and
              keywords to find what they need, rather than scrolling through what was previously a large grid of report
              names.

          <h3>Reflections</h3>
          <p>The main challenge on this project was to improve the visual design of the component without this being at
            the
            expense of hiding away functionality and available options. We knew from feedback that the
            users found the previous
            grid-based design difficult to filter and that it was overwhelming to be faced with a grid of named reports
            when trying to find a specific one (especially as this relied on the user naming their reports in
            a logical and consistent way). One of my main considerations when re-designing the component was to make
            sure that it was intuitive - there was already a lot of functionality on one page (e.g.
            the options to filter, share, export, tag, view, edit, rename and delete reports) and I didn't want to
            re-design
            the component to look less overwhelming and more visually appealing, but lose visibility of the
            functionality - it was important that the user was still able to easily see all of the options available.
          </p>
          <p>Through creating a thorough prototype, which covered all aspects and functionality of the reporting
            component, I was able to be confident that my designs covered all parts of the user flow and that each part
            was
            designed in a way that made the available functionality obvious. As I took a component-based approach to
            designing the reporting component, the solution I found to the problem of needing to show a lot of options
            on one page was through slide-out panels containing, for example the filtering and tagging functionality.
            The slide-out panels were a constant throughout every page within the reporting component, meaning that the
            user experience was consistent and predictable.</p>

            <p>A key part of the design was a league-table-style

            tiles to create a clear visual hierarchy, for example on the scorecard page I used bold data visualisations
            for the key information on the page to allow users to quickly process the headline metics, with more subtle
            score-only tiles for the less important metrics to reduce cognitive load. </p>

            <p>Once we had identified the key user groups and created the information architecture for each group, I
              worked with the client stakeholders and insight and data teams to scope what specific data and charts each
              user group would need to see on each page. The pages for the Regional Manager and Branch Manager were
              similar in terms of content, so I began by creating wireframes and mock-ups for those user groups,
              iterating and building on the designs following feedback from the insight and data teams and the client
              stakeholders.</p>
            <p>My main aim with the league table design was to clearly show the regions ranked by satisfaction score,
              with the information that was most important to the Regional Manager being immediately visible. I split
              the rankings tables by journey stage to avoid the page becoming too complex or cluttered, reduce cognitive
              load and allow the user to get a snapshot view for each journey stage.</p>
            <p>For the scorecard page, I prioritised the key user tasks for each user story and sought to make those
              tasks the easiest to accomplish in my designs. For example, the priority of a user visiting the scorecard
              page
              would usually be to check the region/branch's NPS and Satisfaction scores and compare these against the
              previous month. I used clear, bold data
              visualisations for these metrics to make them stand out and added colour-coding to show whether the
              performance had improved (green) or dropped (red) so that users could see the performance trajectory at a
              glance.</p>
            <p>Below are the wireframes and designs for the
              league table and scorecard pages.</p>

          <h3>Reflections</h3>
          <p>The design of this dashboard is very simple due to the balance of data visualisations with more simple
            score-based views and in that respect addresses the challenge of reducing cognitive load.</p>
          <p>In terms of next steps, I think the dashboard could be improved by adding more functionality and detail to
            provide the users with greater insights and more context for the data. A good way to achieve this, without
            compromising the clean, simple design, would
            be to include filtering functionality on each page. For example, to improve the league table
            page it would be useful for users to also see the bottom performing regions (e.g. by a toggle switch). It
            would also be useful on this page, to see a snapshot of the regional manager's region's scores, perhaps
            above
            the league table with details of the headline scores and the region's overall ranking to provide more
            context
            for the manager.</p>
