      <p>In my current role, I design ‘voice of the customer’ B2B dashboard solutions
        which help
        insight experts and managers analyse complex data to understand customer satisfaction levels and pain points.
      </p>
      <p>I work with the
        product owner and the development team lead to develop the UX and
        visual design of features and components for the core product. The product is highly customisable and I also
        work as the UX lead on projects to
        design and code the front-end for bespoke
        client implementations of the product.</p>
      <p>Due to client confidentiality I'm unable to share specific client designs so designs on this page
        have been anonymised.</p>

            <h4>Insights Dashboard: client in the Airline industry</h4>
            <p>The client was struggling to gain in-depth insight into their customer journeys and satisfaction levels
              using their existing insights dashboard. Their existing dashboard was too simplistic and did not meet the
              needs of the many different user groups - users were not able to drill-down into the data to get the
              information they needed, nor did the dashboard provide a sufficient overview for users who needed a
              high-level snapshot of their team's performance.</p>
            <p>We designed and built a new dashboard from scratch, focusing on addressing the differing needs of each
              user group.</p>

          <h4>My Role</h4>
          <p>As the UX lead for the project I was responsible for the UX and UI design of the site, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Collaborating with the client at scoping sessions to translate different user group requirements into
              usable designs</li>
            <li>Working with the data and insight teams to map the information architecture</li>
            <li>Leading the end-to-end design phase</li>
            <li>Building the front-end of the site and co-ordinating build tasks with the data team</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Project Challenges & Outcomes</h4>
          <p>The main challenge on this project was designing for so many different user groups, each with varying
            requirements. To overcome this challenge, we mapped out different user flows and created unique sets of
            pages for each user group. User access to these pages would be controlled in
            the dashboard by assigned user roles and permissions. We consulted with representatives from the different
            user groups at the prototyping stage, gathering feedback as part of the iterative design process to ensure
            the needs of each user group were met.</p>
          <p>The resulting dashboard included bespoke pages for five different user groups. In the second phase of
            development we added further sets of bespoke pages for 3 more user groups.</p>

          <p>Using the user stories, I tailored pages to each user group with simple score-based views for the cabin
            and
            on-the-ground users who needed to be able to quickly identify their performance against their targets
            whilst
            they were on the move, including how their scores compared with other teams and performance of their
            individual team members. The Head Office and management level views were more complex, showing more
            detailed
            analytics and including the functionality for those users to see a high level overview with the option to
            drill down further into the data, for example by filtering the results, and to create and save reports.
          </p>
          <p>Around half of users in the user groups we identified would be accessing the site only on mobile devices
            as
            they were not office-based. I created mockups and wireframes for both mobile and desktop depending on the
            user group I was designing for, and sought and acted upon feedback from the relevant stakeholders before
            creating the final prototypes using Sketch and InVision.</p>

          <p>The original design was grid-based, with saved reports simply listed in a grid format.
            Qualitative user feedback indicated that users found this grid difficult to filter and search, making
            it
            difficult to find reports they had previously created. I focused on creating a more visual, clean UI

          <p>In the re-design, I moved towards a more visual, tile-based approach where users would be able to
            see
            a
            thumbnail of
            the previously saved report so they would not have to rely on remembering the name of the report to find
            it
            again. I also incorporated slide-out panels into the design to allow users to easily filter and search for
            reports.</p>
          <p>
            As the user flow for the reporting component is quite complex, I simplified the options available to the
            user
            by
            designing each report tile to be interactive, with a list of options (edit, view, share etc.) available on
            hover.</p>
          <p>My main aim with this re-design was to make the reporting page less overwhelming for the user, more
            intuitive
            and visually appealing. Showing only 6 reports at a time encourages the user to filter the reports by tags
            and
            keywords to find what they need, rather than scrolling through what was previously a large grid of report
            names.

              management and insight professionals to easily monitor the bank's performance against its KPIs
              in

              option
              to
              view
              details of best practices followed in those regions to drive improvement across the whole business.
