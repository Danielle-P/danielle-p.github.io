      <p>In my current role as Senior UX Designer at KPMG, I design ‘voice of the customer’ B2B dashboard solutions
        which help
        insight experts and managers analyse complex data, to understand customer needs and pain points. I work with the
        product owner and development team lead to develop the UX and
        visual design of features and components for the core product. The product is highly customisable and I also
        work as the UX lead on projects to
        design and code the front-end for bespoke
        client implementations of the product, which are fully responsive with a
        focus on data
        visualisations and customer analytics.</p>
      <p>Due to client confidentiality I am unfortunately unable to share specific client designs so those I've

              <h4>Insights Dashboard: client in the Airline industry</h4>
              <p>The client was struggling to gain in-depth insight into their customer journeys and satisfaction levels
                using
                their existing insights dashboard. The existing dashboard was too simplistic and did not meet the needs
                of
                the
                many different user groups - users were not able to
                drill-down into the data to get the information they needed, nor did the dashboard provide a sufficient
                overview
                for
                users who
                needed a high-level snapshot of their team's performance.</p>
              <p>We designed and built a new dashboard, focusing
                on
                addressing the differing needs of each user group.</p>

          <h4>My Role</h4>
          <p>The project involved creating a dashboard site to be used internally by a well-known client in the airline
            industry. The purpose of the site was to allow managers and the insight team to monitor their
            customer satisfaction scores against their targets, analyse customer
            experience data and prioritise actions accordingly.</p>

          <h4>Ideation and Design</h4>
          <p>We identified that the site would be primarily intended for several different user groups, including staff
            managing ground
            operations teams, cabin crew managers and Head Office staff reporting to the leadership team. Around half of
            these
            users would be
            accessing the site only on mobile devices as they were not office-based. I tailored pages to each user
            group,
            with
            simple
            score-based views for the on-the-ground users who needed to be able to quickly identify their performance
            against
            their targets and see how their individual team members were performing. The Head Office and management
            level
            views
            were more complex, showing more detailed analytics and including the
            functionality for those users to see a high level overview with the option to drill down further into the
            data
            (for
            example
            by filtering the results) and to create/save
            reports.</p>

          <p>I created mockups and wireframes for both mobile and desktop, and sought feedback from the relevant
            stakeholders on
            both sets before creating the final prototypes using Sketch and InVision. I followed Agile best practices
            when
            building the front-end of the site.</p>

          <h4>Product Design: reporting component</h4>
          <p>Working closely with product owners and
            developers, I design modules and components for our core product.</p>
          <p>I re-designed our
            reporting
            component, where clients can save charts and other data visualisations as reports which they can share and
            later
            refer back to.</p>
          <p>The original design was grid-based, with saved reports simply listed in a grid format.
            Qualitative user feedback indicated that users found this grid difficult to filter and search, making it
            difficult to find reports they had previously created. I focused on creating a more visual, clean UI with
            a
            clear and
            intuitive search and filter component.</p>
          <div class="team-details">

      </div>

      <h4>Ideation and Design</h4>
      <p>In the below re-design, I moved towards a more visual, tile-based approach where users would be able to see a
        thumbnail of
        the previously saved report so they would not have to rely on remembering the name of the report to find it
        again. I also incorporated slide-out panels into the design to allow users to easily filter and search for
        reports.</p>
      <p>
        As the user flow for the reporting component is quite complex, I simplified the options available to the user
        by
        designing each report tile to be interactive, with a list of options (edit, view, share etc.) available on
        hover.</p>

      <p>My main aim with this re-design was to make the reporting page less overwhelming for the user, more intuitive
        and visually appealing. Showing only 6 reports at a time encourages the user to filter the reports by tags and
        keywords to find what they need, rather than scrolling through what was previously a large grid of report
        names.
