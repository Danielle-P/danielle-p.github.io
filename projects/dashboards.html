  <h1>Dashboard Design</h1>
  <p>A fundamental part of my current role at KPMG is designing data visualisations and dashboards, and then building
    the
    front-ends for these dashboards. Due to client confidentiality I am unfortunately unable to share the designs I have
    created during my time at KPMG, however, to illustrate the type of dashboard designs I have worked on, I have
    created
    some mock-ups of dashboards and data visualisations similar to those we build. Please note these designs are not
    specific to any clients I have worked with and, where I have used company branding, I have not worked on designs or
    dashboards for these companies.</p>

  <p>This simple dashboard homepage has the purpose of providing a high level overview of the business’s performance
    against its KPIs and key customer satisfaction data for each of its main journey stages.</p>

  <p>In this design I decided to use Monzo’s branding to experiment with a dark-themed dashboard. I kept the tile
    backgrounds light, however, to make the data easy to read and to allow for the clear use of colour-coding based on
    performance against targets/previous scores.</p>

  <p>The first row of cards gives an overview of customer satisfaction scores against the business’s targets with
    colour-coding on the top border of each card to illustrate in which categories the business is performing well and
    in
    which performance is dropping. To allow the user to view further information, for example to see the scores vs the
    previous month and vs target, I added a button to each card to flip the card around and display a column chart with
    data labels on each column. Using a column chart with data labels gives user a quick and visual overview of the
    difference in score vs the last month/year and vs target whilst also providing the data for further analysis.</p>

  <p>The section below shows satisfaction scores for key journey stages, with each score being clickable. On click, an
    area
    chart slides down showing trended data for the selected journey stage and the trended data for the business’s
    overall
    satisfaction score. Using an area chart in this way clearly shows at what points the satisfaction score for the
    journey stage dropped below the average business-wide satisfaction score.</p>

  <p>I have found journey-style views such as this, which combine a visualisation of the journey stages with data
    alongside
    the option to drill down further into the data, to be particularly popular with customer insight professionals as it
    provides a clear overview of the data and also the context of that data.</p>

  <p>The ‘satisfaction by country’ chart gives an overview of the customer sentiment (promoter, passive or detractor)
    across the regions within that country.</p>

  <p>I used highcharts to mock up both the area chart and the chart to show satisfaction by state as I primarily use a
    combination of highcharts and razor templates in my role at KPMG, both in the design of dashboards and in the
    front-end build of the sites.</p>
