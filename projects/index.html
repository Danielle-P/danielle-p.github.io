        <h2>The Idea & Specification</h2>
        <p>The idea for MealsUp originated from our intention to become more organised in planning meals, to reduce
          waste and to make scheduling healthy and interesting meals easy in the context of a busy lifestyle. We thought
          these were challenges many people faced.</p>
        <p>The aim was therefore to create an easy to use IOS App for scheduling meals. We also wanted to incorporate
          automatic generation of shopping lists based on the meals scheduled.</p>
        <p>We identified three fundamental components for the App:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>List of Dishes - the ability to create and save ‘Dishes’, with an accompanying list of ingredients,
            including quantities, and an optional link to an online recipe.</li>
          <li>Meals schedule or ‘Menu’ - a simple list view of Dishes scheduled on each day, broken down into:
          <li>Mealtime (the names of which are customisable), e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner</li>
          <li>Course - starter, main, side 1, side 2 and dessert</li>
          </li>
          <li>Groceries list - a list of ingredients automatically added to a groceries/shopping list when a Dish is
            scheduled, plus any which are manually added by the user. Groceries are split between:
          <li>Groceries tagged as ‘need to be purchased in the next shopping trip’</li>
          <li>Groceries which are in the list, but which the user has not tagged as ‘next shop’, i.e. they are
            needed but will need to be purchased at some time in the future (e.g. for a meal scheduled in a week’s
            time).</li>
          <li>Groceries which have been marked as purchased/ticked off the list for reference so that other members
            of the household can see what has already been purchased.</li>
          </li>
          <li>The ability to share all of the above in real time with others in the same household who also have
            the App.</li>
        </ul>
