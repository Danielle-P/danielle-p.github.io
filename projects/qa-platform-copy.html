    <p>I currently work as a product designer for a start-up called Global App Testing, which offers crowd-sourced QA testing. My role here is extremely varied as I have worked with product managers and engineers to design a new SaaS platform from scratch. This has involved conducting research to understand and analyse the problem space, using this research data to create an MVP and then iterating on the MVP based on the results of experiments and feedback to the point where we have a saleable product.</p>
    <p>The premise of the platform is that customers can test their apps with our crowd by launching tests themselves from our platform. These tests are sent to our crowd of QA testers and out customers receive results within the platform, which they can then export to their bug-tracking tools.</p>
    <p>Here is a case study of one of the projects I worked on recently.</p>

            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>After the creation of the MVP, we heard from customers that one of the pain points experienced in the QA process was the time it takes customers to triage bugs found. We knew this was an important problem area to focus on because our research showed QA teams were often under-resourced and experienced a lot of time pressure.</p>
            <p>Making it quicker and easier for QA teams to triage issues would help our customers to process and fix issues found by our testers, and therefore allow for quicker releases.</p>

          <h4>The Project Objective & My Role</h4>
          <p>The objective of the project was to facilitate an effective triage process by implementing a simple bug workflow to:
            <ul>
              <li>Enable an easy and quick triage flow within our platform</li>
              <li>Make the triaging process highly visible to help team communication</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>We also wanted to track the bug acceptance rate to monitor both the bug reporting quality and the adoption of the triaging functionality</p>
          <p>My role was to lead the design of this project. I worked with the Product Manager in the discovery phase from the beginning, speaking to customers to ascertain the most important problems and pain points to solve. I then designed the first iteration of the feature in collaboration with the Product Manager and Lead Engineer, which included workshopping ideas, creating concept mock-ups through to clickable wireframes. I tested the wireframes with customers before deciding on the final designs. Having monitored the data and usage of the feature, I identified improvements that could be made in the second iteration of the design.</p>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <div class="page-content-width">
            <p>We knew that with the current design, which did not contain any triaging functionality or formal triaging flow, was resulting in customers spending up to 4 times as long triaging their results as they would like. We also knew what the main pain points were around triaging bugs and we had a good understanding of the context of QAs and developers, and understood the risks and negative consequences of a bad triaging flow. In light of this, with the product manager and lead engineer we looked at our current platform and workshopped:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What might be the simplest way to introduce a triaging workflow so that we can speed up the triaging time?</li>
              <li>Can we achieve this using the existing page view?</li>
              <li>Can we create an intuitive and easy-to-use triaging flow within the current technical constraints?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After brainstorming, we decided that an accept/reject button for each bug would be a quick way to solve the customers' problems - it would allow them to hide rejected bugs, communicate the triage status of bugs to others in their teams and be a great first step towards enabling better bug triaging.</p>
            <p>This was a change that could be made reasonably quickly in the code, however we were concerned that it would cause problems if we introduced it within the existing design. The existing design showed the issues in an expandable accordion view. Adding the option to accept/reject bugs within this already information-heavy view would cause various problems which might actually slow down the triaging process and be detrimental to the user experience:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>adding more to the existing view would make it feel overcrowded and may be too overwhelming for the user</li>
              <li>depending on where the buttons were placed, the user might not even notice these buttons</li>
              <li>adding the buttons at the most-prominent top level for each bug would mean we would have to sacrifice showing other information which should take priority</li>
              <li>we would have limited options to add to or experiment with the triaging feature (such as adding further useful information) due to constraints within the existing page layout</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After mocking up some potential solutions, we realised it would be better to change the structure of the page to allow us to better solve the problem for the customer. The options we had within the existing page did not effectively solve the customers problem, so we decided to move away from the accordion view and link to each bug separately, so each bug would be shown on it's own page. The next step was to scope out this work with the engineers so that we could gain an understanding of how much more work this would be to implement.</p>

          <p>After fully defining the problem and working through the technical constraints with the engineers, we defined the requirements for the first iteration of the triage flow as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the bugs list should be filterable in some way so that users can avoid seeing the 'noise' of rejected bugs, making it easier for them to focus only on the valid bugs</li>
            <li>the layout will be restructured so that each bug is shown on an individual page</li>
            <li>accept/reject buttons need to be highly visible, easy to click, and it needs to be clear to users what these terms mean</li>
            <li>ideally, there would be a way to allow users to easily navigate to the next bug in the list to speed up the triage flow</li>
            <li>the reason for rejecting a bug should be shown in the UI. We can use the data we have to find out the most common reasons a bug is not valid</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We also had the following constraints:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>where possible we should use components within the existing design system</li>
            <li>layout changes for the bug information should be kept to a minimum to keep the migration of bugs to a separate page simple to implement</li>
            <li>allowing the user to navigate back to a previous issue is out of scope due to complexity</li>

          <h3>Reflections and Further Changes</h3>
          <p>The data and feedback from our customers showed that some improvements could be made to the triage flow to make the triage process even quicker and easier, and to further increase adoption rates:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>accept and reject buttons could still be more obvious (this came from customer feedback and also from viewing HotJar recordings</li>
            <li>make the 'next issue' button more prominent</li>
            <li>layout improvements to create better visual hierarchy</li>
            <li>show how many issues remain in the 'not triaged' lists</li>
            <li>incorporate a 'previous issue' button</li>
            <li>we could improve adoption rate by disabling the export button unless an issue is accepted</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I updated the design to address some of the above points. As this was a recent project, I have not yet been able to monitor the impact of the new design as we do not yet have enough customer data.</p>
