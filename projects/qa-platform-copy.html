    <p>I currently work as a product designer for a start-up called Global App Testing, which offers crowd-sourced QA testing. My role here is extremely varied as I have worked with product managers and engineers to design a new SaaS platform from scratch. This has involved conducting research to understand and analyse the problem space, using this research data to create an MVP and then iterating on the MVP based on the results of experiments and feedback to the point where we have a saleable product.</p>
    <p>The premise of the platform is that customers can test their apps with our crowd by launching tests themselves from our platform. These tests are sent to our crowd of QA testers and out customers receive results within the platform, which they can then export to their bug-tracking tools.</p>
    <p>Here is a case study of one of the projects I worked on recently.</p>

            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>After the creation of the MVP, we heard from customers that one of the pain points experienced in the QA process was the time it takes customers to triage bugs found. We knew this was an important problem area to focus on because our research showed QA teams were often under-resourced and experienced a lot of time pressure.</p>
            <p>Making it quicker and easier for QA teams to triage issues would help our customers to process and fix issues found by our testers, and therefore allow for quicker releases.</p>

          <h4>The Project Objective & My Role</h4>
          <p>The objective of the project was to facilitate an effective triage process by implementing a simple bug workflow to:
            <ul>
              <li>Enable an easy and quick triage flow within our platform</li>
              <li>Make the triaging process highly visible to help team communication</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>We also wanted to track the bug acceptance rate to monitor both the bug reporting quality and the adoption of the triaging functionality</p>
          <p>My role was to lead the design of this project. I worked with the Product Manager in the discovery phase from the beginning, speaking to customers to ascertain the most important problems and pain points to solve. I then designed the first iteration of the feature in collaboration with the Product Manager and Lead Engineer, which included workshopping ideas, creating concept mock-ups through to clickable wireframes. I tested the wireframes with customers before deciding on the final designs. Having monitored the data and usage of the feature, I identified improvements that could be made in the second iteration of the design.</p>

          <p>Using the user stories, I tailored pages to each user group with simple score-based views for the
            cabin/in-flight
            and
            on-the-ground users who needed to be able to quickly identify their performance against their targets
            whilst
            they were on the move, including how their scores compared with other teams and performance of their
            individual team members.</p>
          <p>The Head Office and management level scores page designs were more complex, showing more
            detailed
            analytics and including the functionality for those users to see a high level overview with the option to
            drill down further into the data by clicking on links to view trended data, or clicking directly on
            metrics to view further data.
          </p>
          <p>Around half of users in the user groups we identified would be accessing the site only on mobile devices
            as
            they were not office-based. I created mockups and wireframes for both mobile and desktop depending on the
            user group I was designing for, and sought and acted upon feedback from the relevant stakeholders before

          <h3>Reflections</h3>
          <p>The design phase for this project was very lengthy due to there being a number of different sets of
            pages, each of which we received user feedback on. As a result it became quite difficult to manage the
            comments to the pages relevant to them on the prototype. I gained good experience on this project
            in managing that user feedback, with the key learning points being to set a hard deadline for receiving the
            feedback
            and
            to
            collate the feedback before acting on any of it. This makes the process much more manageable in terms of
            both
            reviewing the feedback efficiently in one session and identifying common themes in order to prioritise if
            and how
            feedback points should
            be actioned.</p>
          <p>In terms of the project output, the client has seen a large increase in the number of users logging
            on to their dashboard to monitor their scores compared to the number of logins on their previous dashboard.
            User feedback since launch has been very positive, with the dashboard extended to a number of additional
            user groups who requested similar designs and functionality to the existing pages.</p>
