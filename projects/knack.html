      <p>I'm currently a Senior Product Designer At Knack, a no-code platform that helps users build custom web
        applications. I work with a small team of 2 product managers and a designer to design our builder-side and
        live app side experiences.
      <p>I am responsible for the end-to-end design across the three main areas of the platform:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Builder interface to set up and manage data, user roles, rules, flows</li>
        <li>Page Editor where users build the experience for their end users</li>
        <li>Live App interface, where the end-users can access the application</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <div class="full-width-panel-highlight">
    <div class="panel">
      <p>My recent projects have included co-leading the redesign of the
        entire platform. This included supporting my designer colleague on restructuring and rebuilding the UI of the
        Builder interface, whilst leading on the redesign of the Live App side.</p>
      <p>As part of this I have maintained and expanded upon an existing design system, and scaled it to
        accommodate multiple themes, presets and elements for our customers' Live Apps.</p>

      <p>Full details of what I have worked on at Knack are
        confidential, but for more information about my role here please <a href="/contact/index.html">get in
          touch.</a></p>
