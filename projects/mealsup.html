      <p>I must have downloaded every app remotely related to menu planning before I found this one, and this is
        where
        I’m stopping! The clean design makes it easy to see what I’m doing at a glance, and I can sync it with
        both
        my
        iPad and my phone, as well as being able to loop my boyfriend’s phone in on it too. I can save all my
        recipes,
        as well as search by ingredients, which is perfect!</p>
      <p>Seriously, if you want a nice, easy meal planner and

    <h4>The Project & Idea</h4>
    <p>As a side project, as part of a two-person team, I co-created a meal planning iOS App which now has over 14,000
      users. I had sole
      responsibility for designing from scratch the user experience and UI.</p>
    <p>The idea for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mealsup/id1200169378">MealsUp</a> originated from an
      intention to become more organised in planning meals, reduce
      waste and to make scheduling healthy and interesting meals easy in the context of a busy lifestyle. We thought
      these were challenges many people faced.</p>
    <p>The aim was to create an easy-to-use iOS App for scheduling meals. We also wanted to incorporate the automatic
      generation of shopping lists based on the meals scheduled.</p>
    <p>We identified three main components for the App:</p>

    <div class="panel two-column">
      <div class="info-section">
        <ul>
          <li>List of Dishes: create and save ‘Dishes’, with an
            accompanying list of ingredients,
            quantities, and an optional link to an online recipe.</li>
          <li>Menu: a list view of Dishes scheduled by day, broken down into mealtimes and
            course.</li>
          <li>Groceries: a list of groceries required. Ingredients are
            automatically
            added to the list when a Dish is
            scheduled and can also be added manually. Groceries can be filtered to show items which
            are tagged as ‘need to be purchased
            in the next shopping trip’ and items which have been ticked off the list.</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>The Design</h4>
    <p>I was responsible for the design of MealsUp. The design decisions I made were based on replacing the
      process
      of physically writing a menu and writing a shopping list based on what the dishes/recipes
      require. This approach helped to keep the App simple and easy to use, and ensured the functionality was
      intuitive and familiar.</p>
    <p>We initially worked on the three main features which were mocked up in the initial wireframes, with a view
      to
      getting the MVP on the App Store as soon as possible. We then began to work on the
      ideas for extra features that we had identified during the design process.</p>

    <h4>Additional Features</h4>
    <p>Following the initial releases of MealsUp, we refined some of the designs and added extra views and
      functionality, including:</p>
    <div class="panel">
      <ul>
        <li>Reminder function for the groceries list, reminding the user to buy the items on the next shop</li>
        <li>Notifications when other members of the household have scheduled meals, or ticked off items on the
          groceries
          list</li>
        <li>A ‘Surprise Me’ function to randomly generate an entire meal or a specific course from the user's list
          of
          dishes in the App</li>
        <li>Basic machine learning engine to recommend ingredients when a user creates a dish, based on its name
        </li>
        <li>Images of dishes derived from the link to the dish’s online recipe</li>
        <li>A method view, with the method taken from the online recipe added to the Dish</li>
      </ul>

    <h4>A Use Case</h4>
    <p>One of our users is a care home worker in the US, who uses MealsUp to schedule meals for her patients and to
      manage the ordering and purchase of ingredients in specific quantities each
      week. This user requested the option to print the menu so that it could be displayed on a board within the
      care
      home, which was particularly important as some of the residents had allergies or were on specialised diets.
      This feature has now been added in to the Menu section of the App.</p>
