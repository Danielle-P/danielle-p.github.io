      <h2>Brief</h2>
      <p>As a personal side project, I built a fully responsive wedding website that included the
        following key features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>RSVP functionality for guests</li>
        <li>Ability to add to a Spotify playlist</li>
        <li>Dedicated pages outlining schedules, venues, and other essential details</li>
        <li>Photo gallery with the option for guests to upload their own images</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The primary goal was to create an accessible and intuitive user experience that accommodated a wide range of
        ages and technical abilities.</p>
      <p>Since most guests would access the site via a link included in a digital invitation, I adopted a mobile-first
        approach to ensure optimal usability across devices.</p>

      <div class="info-section">
        <p>As the couple had already chosen a template for an invitation, I began by creating a simple colour palette
          using
          the
          image on the invitation as a starting point.</p>
        <p>Whilst the initial colour palette was WCAG compliant, once I had begun building the page it became
          clear
          that
          the colours in my design were not bold enough when viewed on mobile devices. I therefore increased the colour
          contrasts to make the text clearer and the design look bolder and cleaner.</p>
        <p>As the site was to be relatively light content-wise, I decided to add a background image to the header of
          each page
          to
          add some visual interest. Beginning with the RSVP/Homepage, I chose images that broadly matched the theme of
          the
          wedding invitation and the tone of the copy the couple had provided. The challenge I faced with adding the
          images
          when
          building the site was making sure the text was still readable, particularly on mobile devices or low
          resolution
          screens.</p>

    <h2>Build and Functionality</h2>
    <p>My main focus was again on the RSVP form, this being the primary
      reason
      for
      users to visit the site.</p>
    <p>As many of the guests would be RSVP-ing on behalf of their partners or families as well as themselves, I
      included a
      dropdown box to allow users to select how many guests they were RSVP-ing for. Selecting an option from the
      dropdown
      box would then show an extra section of the form for each guest. Including the vegetarian and dietary
      requirements
      checkboxes for each guest individually meant the database would have clear dietary information per guest.
    </p>
    <p>As the website design was relatively simple with only 4 pages, I used standard HTML, LESS and JavaScript.
      For
      the RSVP form, I used React.</p>
