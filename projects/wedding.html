  <h1>Website Case Study</h1>

        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>To build a user-friendly wedding website with the following requirements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Functionality for guests to RSVP</li>
          <li>Ability to add to a Spotify playlist</li>
          <li>Pages detailing timings and other useful wedding information</li>
          <li>A gallery page including functionality for guests to upload photos</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Design</h2>
        <p>I began by identifying the content required and splitting it into logical
          categories, which became the basis for the pages. I identified the main purpose of the website to be the RSVP
          functionality
          and
          the
          couple also mentioned they were keen for guests to add to their Spotify playlist, so these two sections
          became
          my
          starting point.</p>

        <p>As most of the guests would be receiving the wedding invitation
          by
          email,
          which would include a link to the website, it was likely that most guests would view the
          website
          primarily on mobile devices. I therefore designed the site mobile-first.</p>
        <p>As the couple had already chosen a template for an invitation, I began by creating a simple colour palette
          using
          the
          image on the invitation as a starting point.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-section perspective four-img initial-designs">
        <div class="project-image image-intersect">
          <img class="lazy" src="/images/wedding/design-process-1.jpg" alt="Wedding invitation" />
        </div>
        <div class="project-image image-intersect">
          <img class="lazy" src="/images/wedding/design-process-2.png" alt="Draft colour scheme" />
        </div>
        <div class="project-image image-intersect">
          <img class="lazy" src="/images/wedding/design-process-3.jpg" alt="Draft homepage" />
        </div>
      </div>

    <div class="panel">
      <div class="info-section">
        <p>Whilst the initial colour palette was WCAG compliant, once I had begun building the page it became
          clear
          that
          the colours in my design were not bold enough when viewed on mobile devices. I therefore increased the colour
          contrasts to make the text clearer and the design look bolder and cleaner.</p>

        <p>As the site was to be relatively light content-wise, I decided to add a background image to the header of
          each page
          to
          add some visual interest. Beginning with the RSVP/Homepage, I chose images that broadly matched the theme of
          the
          wedding invitation and the tone of the copy the couple had provided. The challenge I faced with adding the
          images
          when
          building the site was making sure the text was still readable, particularly on mobile devices or low
          resolution
          screens.</p>

      <h2>The Build and Functionality</h2>
      <p>My main aim when building the site was to make it accessible and intuitive, particularly given the likely
        varying
        ages
        and technical abilities of the users. My main focus was again on the RSVP form, this being the primary
        reason
        for
        users to visit the site.</p>
      <p>As many of the guests would be RSVP-ing on behalf of their partners or families as well as themselves, I
        included a
        dropdown box to allow users to select how many guests they were RSVP-ing for. Selecting an option from the
        dropdown
        box would then show an extra section of the form for each guest. Including the vegetarian and dietary
        requirements
        checkboxes for each guest individually meant the database would have clear dietary information per guest.
      </p>
      <p>As the website design was relatively simple with only 4 pages, I used standard HTML, LESS and JavaScript.
        For
        the RSVP form, I used React.</p>
