        <h2>The brief</h2>
        <p>To build a user-friendly website with the following requirements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Functionality for guests to RSVP</li>
          <li>Include a feature to add to a Spotify Playlist</li>
          <li>A page informing guests of timings on the wedding day</li>
          <li>Pages for other useful wedding information</li>
          <li>A gallery page where guests can upload photos</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Design</h2>
        <p>I began by identifying the content which needed to be included on each page; I split the content into logical
          categories, which became the pages. I identified the main purpose of the website to be the RSVP functionality
          and
          the
          couple also mentioned they were keen for guests to add to their Spotify playlist, so these two sections became
          my
          starting point.</p>

        <p>As most of the guests would be receiving the wedding invitation
          by
          email,
          with a link to the wedding website included in that email, it was likely that most guests would view the
          website
          primarily on mobile devices. I therefore designed the site mobile-first.</p>
        <p>As the couple had already chosen a template for an invitation, I began by creating a simple colour palette
          using
          the
          colours from the image to be used on that invitation.</p>

        <p>Whilst the colour contrasts I had chosen were WCAG compliant, once I had begun building the page it became
          clear
          that
          the colours in my design were not bold enough when viewed on mobile devices. I therefore increased the colour
          contrasts to make the text clearer and the design look bolder and cleaner.</p>

        <p>As the site was to be relatively light content-wise, I decided to add a background image to the header of
          each page
          to
          add some visual interest. Beginning with the RSVP/Homepage, I chose images that broadly matched the theme of
          the
          wedding invitation and the tone of the copy the couple had provided. The challenge I faced with adding the
          images
          when
          building the site was making sure the text was still readable, particularly on mobile devices or low
          resolution
          screens.</p>

        <h2>The Build</h2>
        <p>My main aim when building the site was to make it accessible and intuitive, particularly given the likely
          varying
          age
          and technical abilities of the users. My main focus was again on the RSVP form, this being the primary
          reason
          for
          users to visit the site.</p>
        <p>As many of the guests would be RSVP-ing on behalf of their partners or families as well as themselves, I
          included a
          dropdown box to allow users to select how many guests they were RSVP-ing for. Selecting an option from the
          dropdown
          box would then show an extra section of the form for each guest. Including the vegetarian and dietary
          requirements
          checkboxes for each guest individually meant the database would have clear dietary information per guest.
        </p>
        <p>As the website design was relatively simple with only 4 pages, I used standard HTML, LESS and JavaScript.
          For
          the RSVP form, I used React.</p>
