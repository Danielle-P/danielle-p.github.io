    <p>I currently work as a product designer for a start-up called Global App Testing, which offers crowd-sourced QA testing. My role here is extremely varied as I have worked with product managers and engineers to design a new SaaS platform from scratch. This has involved conducting research to understand and analyse the problem space, using this research data to create an MVP and then iterating on the MVP based on the results of experiments and feedback to the point where we have a saleable product.</p>
    <p>The premise of the platform is that customers can test their apps with our crowd by launching tests themselves from our platform. These tests are sent to our crowd of QA testers and out customers receive results within the platform, which they can then export to their bug-tracking tools.</p>
    <p>Here is a case study of one of the projects I worked on recently.</p>

          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p>After the creation of the MVP, we heard from customers that one of the pain points experienced in the QA process was the time it takes customers to triage bugs found. We knew this was an important problem area to focus on because our research showed QA teams were often under-resourced and experienced a lot of time pressure.</p>
          <p>Making it quicker and easier for QA teams to triage issues would help our customers to process and fix issues found by our testers, and therefore allow for quicker releases.</p>
          <h4>The Team</h4>

        <h4>The Project Objective & My Role</h4>
        <h4>The Project Objective & My Role</h4>
        <p>The objective of the project was to facilitate an effective triage process by implementing a simple bug workflow to:
          <ul>
            <li>Enable an easy and quick triage flow within our platform</li>
            <li>Make the triaging process highly visible to help team communication</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We also wanted to track the bug acceptance rate to monitor both the bug reporting quality and the adoption of the triaging functionality</p>
        <p>My role was to lead the design of this project. I worked with the Product Manager in the discovery phase from the beginning, speaking to customers to ascertain the most important problems and pain points to solve. I then designed the first iteration of the feature in collaboration with the Product Manager and Lead Engineer, which included workshopping ideas, creating concept mock-ups through to clickable wireframes. I tested the wireframes with customers before deciding on the final designs. Having monitored the data and usage of the feature, I identified improvements that could be made in the second iteration of the design.</p>

        <p>Using the user stories, I tailored pages to each user group with simple score-based views for the
          cabin/in-flight
          and
          on-the-ground users who needed to be able to quickly identify their performance against their targets
          whilst
          they were on the move, including how their scores compared with other teams and performance of their
          individual team members.</p>
        <p>The Head Office and management level scores page designs were more complex, showing more
          detailed
          analytics and including the functionality for those users to see a high level overview with the option to
          drill down further into the data by clicking on links to view trended data, or clicking directly on
          metrics to view further data.
        </p>
        <p>Around half of users in the user groups we identified would be accessing the site only on mobile devices
          as
          they were not office-based. I created mockups and wireframes for both mobile and desktop depending on the
          user group I was designing for, and sought and acted upon feedback from the relevant stakeholders before
          creating the final prototypes using Sketch and InVision.</p>

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>The design phase for this project was very lengthy due to there being a number of different sets of
          pages, each of which we received user feedback on. As a result it became quite difficult to manage the
          feedback in InVision, the prototyping tool we were using, as there were a number of different users adding
          comments to the pages relevant to them on the prototype. I gained good experience on this project
          in managing that user feedback, with the key learning points being to set a hard deadline for receiving the
          feedback
          and
          to
          collate the feedback before acting on any of it. This makes the process much more manageable in terms of
          both
          reviewing the feedback efficiently in one session and identifying common themes in order to prioritise if
          and how
          feedback points should
          be actioned.</p>
        <p>In terms of the project output, the client has seen a large increase in the number of users logging
          on to their dashboard to monitor their scores compared to the number of logins on their previous dashboard.
          User feedback since launch has been very positive, with the dashboard extended to a number of additional
          user groups who requested similar designs and functionality to the existing pages.</p>
