    <p>I'm currently the sole product designer at Vaayu, a climate-tech startup which provides companies with the tools
      to calculate, track and reduce their carbon emissions.</p>
    <p>The platform includes 3 main elements:
    <ul>
      <li>a carbon emissions
        tracking
        dashboard</li>
      <li>a scenarios modelling and target-setting tool</li>
      <li>a feature to allow customers to track the accuracy
        and completeness of data across their supply chain.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>My role is the end-to-end design across all three areas. I collaborate with climate specialists and industry
      experts to distil complex information and
      intricate workflows into a highly-usable product.</p>

    <p>Full details of what I have worked on at Vaayu are
      confidential, but for more information about my role here more generally <a href="/contact/index.html">contact

            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>After the creation of the MVP, we heard from customers that one of the pain points experienced in the QA
              process was the time it takes customers to triage issues (bugs) found within their apps. We knew this
              was
              an
              important
              problem area
              to focus on because our research showed QA teams were often under-resourced and experienced a lot of time
              pressure, so this pain point exacerbated wider problems in QA.</p>
            <p>Our hypothesis was that making it quicker and easier for QA teams to triage issues found by our testers
              would help our
              customers to process and fix
              those issues, and therefore allow for quicker releases.</p>

        <div class="page-content-width">
          <h4>Project Objective & My Role</h4>
          <p>The objective of the project was to facilitate an effective triage process by implementing a simple issue
            workflow to:
          <ul>
            <li>Enable an easy and quick triage flow within our platform</li>
            <li>Hide rejected issues from the main issues view</li>
            <li>Make the triaging process highly visible to help team communication</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>We also wanted to track the issue acceptance rate to monitor both the issue reporting quality and the
            adoption
            of the triaging functionality.</p>
          <p>My role was to lead the design of this project. I worked with the Product Manager in the discovery phase
            from the beginning, speaking to customers to ascertain the most important pain points in their triaging
            process.
            I collaborated with the Product Manager and Tech Lead to design the first iteration of the solution, which
            included workshopping ideas and creating concept
            mock-ups through to clickable prototypes. I
            tested wireframes and prototypes with customers before finalising the designs. Having monitored the data and
            usage of the feature, I then identified improvements that could be made in the second iteration of the
            design.
