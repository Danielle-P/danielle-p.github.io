  <h1>MealsUp</h1>
  <div class="project-journey">
    <div class="panel stage odd">
      <span class="journey-marker"></span>
      <div class="info-section">
        <h2>The Idea & Specification</h2>
        <p>The idea for MealsUp originated from our intention to become more organised in planning meals, to reduce
          waste and to make scheduling healthy and interesting meals easy in the context of a busy lifestyle. We thought
          these were challenges many people faced.</p>
        <p>The aim was therefore to create an easy to use IOS App for scheduling meals. We also wanted to incorporate
          automatic generation of shopping lists based on the meals scheduled.</p>
        <p>We identified three fundamental components for the App:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>List of Dishes - the ability to create and save ‘Dishes’, with an accompanying list of ingredients,
            including quantities, and an optional link to an online recipe.</li>
          <li>Meals schedule or ‘Menu’ - a simple list view of Dishes scheduled on each day, broken down into:
          <li>Mealtime (the names of which are customisable), e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner</li>
          <li>Course - starter, main, side 1, side 2 and dessert</li>
          </li>
          <li>Groceries list - a list of ingredients automatically added to a groceries/shopping list when a Dish is
            scheduled, plus any which are manually added by the user. Groceries are split between:
          <li>Groceries tagged as ‘need to be purchased in the next shopping trip’</li>
          <li>Groceries which are in the list, but which the user has not tagged as ‘next shop’, i.e. they are
            needed but will need to be purchased at some time in the future (e.g. for a meal scheduled in a week’s
            time).</li>
          <li>Groceries which have been marked as purchased/ticked off the list for reference so that other members
            of the household can see what has already been purchased.</li>
          </li>
          <li>The ability to share all of the above in real time with others in the same household who also have
            the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Story</h2>
        <p>A typical user story would be:</p>
        <h4>Sign up</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a home and invite other members of the household to that home</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Everyday use</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a dish in the Dishes list.</li>
          <li>Schedule a dish for a specific date and for a specific mealtime in the Menu tab.</li>
          <li>Add any custom ingredients to the groceries list in addition to those automatically generated by adding a
            dish
            to the Menu.</li>
          <li>Mark as ‘next shop’ any groceries needed and tick off those which are not required (i.e. those which the
            user
            already has at home).</li>
          <li>In the supermarket, tick off the groceries as they are purchased.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Design</h2>
        <p>I was responsible for the design of MealsUp. The design decisions I made were based on replacing the process
          of physically writing a menu for the next week and writing a shopping list based on what the dishes/recipes
          required. This approach helped to keep the App simple and easy to use, and ensured the functionality was
          intuitive and familiar.</p>

        <h4>Features we added</h4>
        <p>We initially worked on the three main features which were mocked up in the initial wireframes, with a view to
          getting the MVP on the App Store as soon as possible. As soon as we had done that, we began to work on the
          ideas for extra features that we had identified during the design process and during the course of using and
          testing
          the App.</p>

        <p>Additional features we added include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reminder function for the groceries list, reminding the user to buy the items on the next shop</li>
          <li>Notifications when other members of the household have scheduled meals, or ticked off items on the
            groceries
            list</li>
          <li>A ‘Surprise Me’ function to randomly generate an entire meal or a specific course from the user's list of
            dishes in the App</li>
          <li>Basic machine learning engine to recommend ingredients when a user creates a dish, based on its name</li>
          <li>Images of dishes derived from the link to the dish’s online recipe</li>
          <li>An optional homepage dashboard view showing:</li>
          <li>Most- and least-often scheduled dishes in the last 3 months</li>
          <li>A snapshot of the upcoming Menu</li>
          <li>A snapshot of the current groceries list</li>
          <li>Method view</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        <h4>A Use Case</h4>
        <p>One of our users is a care home worker in the US, who uses MealsUp to schedule meals for the residents at the
          care home she works at and to manage the ordering and purchase of ingredients in specific quantities each
          week. This user requested the option to print the menu so that it could be displayed on a board within the
          care
          home, which was particularly important as some of the residents had allergies or were on specialised diets. We
          therefore added this feature in the Menu section of the App.</p>

        <h4>Some reviews from the AppStore</h4>
        <p>"...The clean design makes it easy to see what I’m doing at a glance, and I can sync it with both my
          iPad and my phone, as well as being able to loop my boyfriend’s phone in on it too. I can save all my recipes,
          as well as search by ingredients, which is perfect! Seriously, if you want a nice, easy meal planner and
          grocery list maker, this is it!”</p>
        <p>“Best App ever I love this app! Only app I know that helps plan you meals for the weeks to come and invite
          family member to join and see the menu and add to it. Absolutely love it!“</p>
        <p>“So happy I finally found this. The only meal planner most people who like to cook will ever need”</p>
        <p>“Excellent App to plan your meal”</p>
        <p>“Exactly what I was looking for"</p>
