    <h1>Why I'm Applying to Ghost</h1>

    <p>Over the last 10 years I’ve had the benefit of working across a wide range of organisations, from large
      corporations to early stage start-ups and I’ve learned a lot from each experience. One pattern I’ve noticed is how
      frequent pivots in direction resulting from investor pressure or a focus on aggressive growth can in reality lead
      to a lack of clarity, teams losing sight of the people they’re building for, and ultimately a loss of trust and
      user loyalty. As a designer, I do my best work in environments where users, not investors, are at the centre of
      decision-making and teams are connected to the people using their product.</p>

    <p>I am looking for a company that doesn’t chase trends or follow investor pressures, but instead has a clear
      understanding of who they are creating the product for, and confidently sticks to that mission. Ghost stands out
      to me because of its non-profit, open-sourced model, the transparency with which the company operates, and the
      clarity around its purpose and target users.</p>

    <p>In short, I am hoping to find a company whose values and way of working align with my own; that is, working
      intentionally and thoughtfully to solve problems well for those who are putting their trust into the product and
      company.</p>
