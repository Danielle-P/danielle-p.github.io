      <p class="slide-in">After the completion of my Law degree and LPC, I became a Legal Executive in the field of
        Banking and Financial Services Law. I initially worked for Squire Patton Boggs, a large international
        law
        firm, and then moved
        on to the Yorkshire-based firm Gordons LLP in 2013.</p>

      <p class="slide-in">During my time as a Legal Executive I progressed from working as part of a team of seven on
        banking and financial
        services transactions to managing my own caseload of corporate property finance transactions.</p>

      <p class="slide-in">At both Squire Patton Boggs and Gordons I was part of a team which often had a large
        workload.
        I
        was able to
        efficiently prioritise my various roles, completing individual tasks to deadlines and also assisting the
        team
        with collective projects.</p>

      <p class="slide-in">My experience in Banking Law helped me to build on my ability to work in a high pressure

        opportunity for learning and growth.</p>

      <p class="slide-in">My previous qualifications and experience meant I was able to bring to this role, and my
        future
        roles in this
        sector, sophisticated analytical, problem-solving and commercial reasoning skills.</p>

      <p class="slide-in">I initially joined the KPMG Learning Academy as an Instructional Designer where I gained
        valuable experience in designing for learning and was introduced to the principles of design. This role
        included:</p>

        <li>Liaising with stakeholders on the subject matter of online courses</li>

        the
        team that designs
        and builds the Customer Experience Cloud (CX Cloud) product. In this role I was able to rapidly expand my

      <p class="slide-in">I was promoted to Senior UX Designer in 2018. My role entailed acting

        the UX Lead and
        front-end developer on client projects alongside contributing to the design of elements of the CX Cloud
        product.
      </p>

      <p>I worked with product and engineering teams to design the UX and UI of features, new components and
        modules for
        our core dashboard product. The product itself is highly customisable and I was responsible for the UX design
        and
        the front-end build of bespoke implementations of the product for our clients. Client implementations
        include
        household-name brands in the energy, airline and
        financial sectors.

        My key responsibilities included:</p>

      <ul class="slide-in">
        <li>Being the UX client contact on projects throughout the design and build phases as well as during the BAU
          phase</li>
        <li>Requirements gathering from clients at scoping sessions</li>
        <li>Creating initial designs through to interactive wireframes for client dashboard solutions</li>
        <li>Building the front-end and user interactions for client dashboards</li>
        <li>Delegating and coordinating front-end build tasks</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="slide-in">During my time at KPMG Nunwood I designed and built a number of long-term, successful
        client dashboards
        which are used by up to 40,000 users each month.</p>
