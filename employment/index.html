    <p class="slide-in">I attended the University of Leeds from 2007 to 2010, attaining a 2:1 Law LLB degree and
      ranking
      17th in my
      cohort of over 220 students.</p>
    <p class="slide-in">Following my law degree, I completed the Legal Practice Course (LPC) post-graduate diploma at
      the BPP University
      in Leeds where I was awarded a Distinction. Modules I took during the LPC included Business Law and Practice and
      Intellectual Property Law.</p>

      <h3>Legal Executive</h3>

    </div>
    <p class="slide-in">After the completion of my Law degree and LPC, I became a Legal Executive in the field of
      Banking and Financial Services Law. I initially worked for Squire Patton Boggs, a large international
      law
      firm, and then moved
      on to the Yorkshire-based firm Gordons LLP in 2013.</p>

    <p class="slide-in">During my time as a Legal Executive I progressed from working as part of a team of seven on
      banking and financial
      services transactions to managing my own caseload of corporate property finance transactions.</p>

    <p class="slide-in">At both Squire Patton Boggs and Gordons I was part of a team which often had a large workload.
      I
      was able to
      efficiently prioritise my various roles, completing individual tasks to deadlines and also assisting the
      team
      with collective projects.</p>

    <p class="slide-in">My experience in Banking Law helped me to build on my ability to work in a high pressure
      environment and use my
      initiative to handle unanticipated issues calmly and positively.</p>

      <h3>Tech Solutions Graduate Scheme</h3>

    <p class="slide-in">I joined the KPMG TechSolutions graduate scheme in October 2015. My career change from law
      into
      the technology
      sector was driven by my ambition to work in a less prescriptive and more creative industry with greater
      opportunity for learning and growth.</p>

    <p class="slide-in">My previous qualifications and experience meant I was able to bring to this role, and my
      future
      roles in this
      sector, sophisticated analytical, problem-solving and commercial reasoning skills.</p>

    <p class="slide-in">I initially joined the KPMG Learning Academy as an Instructional Designer where I gained
      valuable experience in designing for learning and was introduced to the principles of design. This role
      included:</p>

    <ul class="slide-in">
      <li>Liaising with stakeholders on the subject matter of online courses</li>
      <li>Writing content for online courses</li>
      <li>Designing user interactions</li>

    <p class="slide-in">In February 2016 I moved to the KPMG Nunwood team to train as a UX Designer, working with the
      team that designs
      and builds the Customer Experience Cloud (CX Cloud) product. In this role I was able to rapidly expand my design
      skills and gained valuable experience in:</p>

    <ul class="slide-in">
      <li>Designing for data visualisation</li>
      <li>Micro-interaction design</li>
      <li>Infographic design</li>
      <li>Designing mock-ups and interactive wireframes</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="slide-in">As a UX designer I also trained in front-end development, including:</p>

    <ul class="slide-in">
      <li>HTML and Bootstrap</li>
      <li>CSS (primarily using LESS)</li>
      <li>jQuery and basic JavaScript</li>

    <p class="slide-in">I was promoted to Senior UX Designer in 2018. As a Senior UX Designer my role entails acting
      as
      the UX Lead and
      front-end developer on client projects alongside contributing to the design of elements of the CX Cloud product.
      My key responsibilities include:</p>

    <ul class="slide-in">
      <li>Being the UX client contact on projects throughout the design and build phases as well as during the BAU
        phase</li>
      <li>Requirements gathering from clients at scoping sessions</li>
      <li>Creating initial designs through to interactive wireframes for client dashboard solutions</li>
      <li>Building the front-end and user interactions for client dashboards</li>
      <li>Delegating and coordinating front-end build tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="slide-in">During my time at KPMG Nunwood I have designed and built a number of long-term, successful
      client dashboards
      which are used by up to 40,000 users each month.</p>
