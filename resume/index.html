                  <p class="slide-in">
                        As the sole product designer, I was responsible for the end-to-end design of a
                        carbon-emissions tracking tool focused on helping retailers measure and reduce their
                        carbon
                        impact. My role centred on designing dashboards and data visualisations that could distil
                        vast,
                        complex datasets into something comprehensive and actionable.

                  <p class="slide-in">
                        The data underpinning the tool spanned entire product lifecycles — from raw
                        materials and factory emissions, through operations and logistics, to the final delivery
                        emissions. I had
                        to
                        quickly develop a strong understanding of both the data and the methodologies in order to
                        design
                        visualisations that were clear and meaningful to end users and supported their
                        decision-making processes.
                  </p>
                  <p class="slide-in">
                        Alongside the main emissions-tracking features and visualisations, I designed a tool that
                        allowed users to model hypothetical changes and see projected impacts on emissions. The
                        focus of this tool was to support businesses in modelling and communicating changes to
                        their own stakeholders which
                        would allow them to define and commit to targets in line with the
                        Science-Based Targets Initiative.

                  <p class="slide-in">
                        The role was broad, spanning discovery through delivery, and relied on close collaboration
                        with climate scientists and industry experts alongside our team of developers,
                        researchers, and the product manager to
                        explore and find usable solutions to complex problems.

                        scaled it

                        flows, signup
                        experiences, and features like custom domains). Recently designed a new AI feature from
