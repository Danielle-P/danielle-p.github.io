                        field of
                        Banking and Financial Services Law. I initially worked for Squire Patton Boggs, a large

                        law
                        firm, and then moved
                        on to the Yorkshire-based firm Gordons LLP in 2013.</p>

                  <p class="slide-in">During my time as a Legal Executive I progressed from working as part of a team of
                        seven on
                        banking and financial
                        services transactions to managing my own caseload of corporate property finance transactions.
                  </p>

                  <p class="slide-in">At both Squire Patton Boggs and Gordons I was part of a team which often had a
                        large
                        workload.
                        I
                        was able to

                        Whilst in this role, my main achievements included designing and building a number of long-term,
                        successful dashboards for household-name brands in the energy, airline and financial sectors and
                        working on a redesign project for the core product, including leading a redesign of the
                        reporting feature.</p>

                  <p class="slide-in">
                        A key part of this role was to design the product to enable efficient workflows but also to
                        create a UI that was simple, uncluttered and appealing to a technical user base. I helped to
                        create our design system based on these principles and completed a full redesign project,
                        which involved talking to people in software teams to understand more about their workflow and
                        context to allow us to create designs that they would find intuitive and engaging.
