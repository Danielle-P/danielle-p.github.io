                        field of
                        Banking and Financial Services Law. I initially worked for Squire Patton Boggs, a large

                        law
                        firm, and then moved
                        on to the Yorkshire-based firm Gordons LLP in 2013.</p>

                  <p class="slide-in">During my time as a Legal Executive I progressed from working as part of a team of
                        seven on
                        banking and financial
                        services transactions to managing my own caseload of corporate property finance transactions.
                  </p>

                  <p class="slide-in">At both Squire Patton Boggs and Gordons I was part of a team which often had a
                        large

                        I
                        was able to

                  <p class="slide-in">I am currently a product designer for a start-up offering crowd-sourced QA
                        testing. My role here
                        is extremely varied as I have been responsible for designing a new SaaS platform from scratch,
                        which has now gone to market. This has involved conducting research, designing the MVP and
                        iterating on it until it became a saleable product.</p>
                  <p class="slide-in">
                        A key part of this role has been to design our product to enable efficient workflows but also to
                        create a UI that is simple, uncluttered and appealing to a technical user base. I helped to
                        create our design system based on these principles and recently completed a redesign project,
                        which involved talking to people in software teams to understand more about their workflow and
                        context to allow us to create designs that they would find intuitive and engaging.

                  <p class="slide-in">
                        I work in a continuous discovery cycle, conducting customer interviews, research and leading
                        solutions exploration and workshops.
