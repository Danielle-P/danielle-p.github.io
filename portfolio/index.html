        In my role as Senior UX Designer at KPMG, I work on designing and
        building bespoke Customer Experience Dashboards which are used
        internally by our clients to analyse customer experience and
        satisfaction data taken from surveys. I have worked most recently with
        household-name brands in the financial, airline and energy sectors to
        deliver a variety of solutions to help those businesses measure
        performance through customer experience data.

        Outside of work I am part of the two-person team that created the app
        MealsUp, which is available on the App Store. MealsUp is designed to be
        a simple, easy to use meal scheduling app with additional features
        including a groceries list automatically generated upon scheduling a
        meal and a method feature which allows users to follow a specific recipe
        whilst cooking.
