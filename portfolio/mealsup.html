  <h1>MealsUp App</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>The Idea & Specification</h2>
    <p>The idea for MealsUp originated from an intention to become more organised in planning meals, reduce
      waste and to make scheduling healthy and interesting meals easy in the context of a busy lifestyle. We thought
      these were challenges many people faced.</p>
    <p>The aim was to create an easy-to-use iOS App for scheduling meals. We also wanted to incorporate the automatic
      generation of shopping lists based on the meals scheduled.</p>

    <div class="panel">
      <div class="info-section">
        <p>We identified three main components for the App:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="text-highlight">List of Dishes:</span> where users can create and save ‘Dishes’, with an
            accompanying list of ingredients,
            quantities, and an optional link to an online recipe.</li>
          <li><span class="text-highlight">Menu:</span> a simple list view of Dishes which have been scheduled on each
            day, broken down into mealtimes and
            course.</li>
          <li><span class="text-highlight">Groceries:</span> a list of groceries required. Ingredients to be
            automatically
            added to the list when a Dish is
            scheduled and can also be added manually by the user. Groceries incorporates two views: items which
            are tagged as ‘need to be purchased
            in the next shopping trip’ and items which have been ticked off the list, for reference.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>The Design</h2>
      <p>I was responsible for the design of MealsUp. The design decisions I made were based on replacing the
        process
        of physically writing a menu and writing a shopping list based on what the dishes/recipes
        require. This approach helped to keep the App simple and easy to use, and ensured the functionality was
        intuitive and familiar.</p>

  <section class="panel">
    <div class="info-section">
      <p>We initially worked on the three main features which were mocked up in the initial wireframes, with a view
        to
        getting the MVP on the App Store as soon as possible. We then began to work on the
        ideas for extra features that we had identified during the design process.</p>

      <p>Additional features we added include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reminder function for the groceries list, reminding the user to buy the items on the next shop</li>
        <li>Notifications when other members of the household have scheduled meals, or ticked off items on the
          groceries
          list</li>
        <li>A ‘Surprise Me’ function to randomly generate an entire meal or a specific course from the user's list
          of
          dishes in the App</li>
        <li>Basic machine learning engine to recommend ingredients when a user creates a dish, based on its name
        </li>
        <li>Images of dishes derived from the link to the dish’s online recipe</li>
        <li>An optional homepage dashboard view showing snapshots of the upcoming menu and groceries list alongside
          details of the most and least-often scheduled dishes</li>
        <li>A method view, with the method taken from the online recipe added to the Dish</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A Use Case</h2>
      <p>One of our users is a care home worker in the US, who uses MealsUp to schedule meals for her patients and to
        manage the ordering and purchase of ingredients in specific quantities each
        week. This user requested the option to print the menu so that it could be displayed on a board within the
        care
        home, which was particularly important as some of the residents had allergies or were on specialised diets.
        We
        therefore added this feature in the Menu section of the App.</p>

      <h2>Testimonials</h2>
      <p>Some reviews from the AppStore:</p>
      <p>"...The clean design makes it easy to see what I’m doing at a glance, and I can sync it with both my
        iPad and my phone, as well as being able to loop my boyfriend’s phone in on it too. I can save all my
        recipes,
        as well as search by ingredients, which is perfect! Seriously, if you want a nice, easy meal planner and
        grocery list maker, this is it!”</p>
      <p>“Best App ever I love this app! Only app I know that helps plan you meals for the weeks to come and invite
        family member to join and see the menu and add to it. Absolutely love it!“</p>
      <p>“So happy I finally found this. The only meal planner most people who like to cook will ever need”</p>
      <p>“Excellent App to plan your meal”</p>
      <p>“Exactly what I was looking for"</p>
