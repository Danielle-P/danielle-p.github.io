  <h1>Dashboard Case Study</h1>

  <div class="panel">
    <div class="info-section">
      <p>A fundamental part of my current role at KPMG is designing data visualisations and dashboards, and then
        building
        the
        front-ends for these dashboards. Due to client confidentiality I am unfortunately unable to share the designs
        I
        have
        created during my time at KPMG, however, to illustrate the type of dashboard designs I have worked on, I have
        put together a dashboard case study. Please note
        these designs are
        not
        specific to any clients I have worked with.</p>
      <p>This simple dashboard homepage has the purpose of providing a high level overview of the business’s
        performance
        against its KPIs and key customer satisfaction data for each of its main journey stages.</p>

      <p>In this design I decided to use Monzo’s branding to experiment with a dark-themed dashboard. I kept the tile
        backgrounds light to make the data easy to read and to allow for the clear use of colour-coding
        based
        on
        performance against targets/previous scores.</p>

      </div>

  <div class="panel">
    <div class="info-section">
      <p>The first row of cards gives an overview of customer satisfaction scores against the business’s targets with
        colour-coding on the top border of each card to illustrate in which categories the business is performing well
        and in which performance is dropping. To allow the user to view further information, for example to see the
        scores vs the previous month and vs target, I added a button to each card to flip the card around and display
        a column chart with data labels on each column. Using a column chart with data labels gives user a quick and
        visual overview of the difference in score vs the last month/year and vs target whilst also providing the data
        for further analysis.

      <p>The section below shows satisfaction scores for key journey stages, with each score being clickable. On
        click, an area chart slides down showing trended data for the selected journey stage and for
        the business’s overall satisfaction score. Using an area chart in this way clearly shows at what points the
        satisfaction score for the journey stage dropped below the average business-wide satisfaction score.</p>

      <p>I have found journey-style views such as this, which combine a visualisation of the journey stages with data
        alongside the option to drill down further into the data, to be particularly popular with customer insight
        professionals as it provides a clear overview of the data and also the context for that data.</p>

      <p>The ‘satisfaction by country’ chart gives an overview of the customer sentiment (promoter, passive or
        detractor) across the regions within that country.</p>

  <div class="panel">
    <p>I used highcharts to mock up both the area chart and the chart to show satisfaction by state as I primarily
      use a combination of highcharts and razor templates in my role at KPMG, both in the design of dashboards and
      in the front-end build of the sites.</p>
