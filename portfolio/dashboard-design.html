  <h1>Dashboard Design</h1>

  <div class="panel">
    <div class="info-section">
      <p>In my current role at KPMG I design fully responsive enterprise dashboard solutions, with a
        focus on data
        visualisations and customer analytics. My role also includes building the
        front-ends for these dashboards.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the dashboards is to provide management and insight
        professionals with customer insights to help them to make key business
        decisions. The dashboard sites I have designed include tailored pages for different user groups across the
        business.
      </p>
      <p>Due to client confidentiality I am unfortunately unable to share the specific designs
        I
        have
        created during my time at KPMG.</p>
      <p>However, to illustrate the type of projects I have enjoyed working on, I have
        recreated
        some mock-ups of dashboards and data visualisations which are based on those I have designed and built. I have
        also
        included the user flows, site maps and initial wireframes.</p>

      <h2 class="tab-heading">Dashboard project for a client in the Airline industry</h2>
      <p>I designed and built a dashboard site to be used internally by a well-known airline company. The purpose of the
        site was to allow managers and the insight team to monitor their
        customer satisfaction scores against their targets, analyse customer
        experience data and prioritise actions accordingly.</p>

      <p>The site was intended for several different user groups, including staff managing ground
        operations teams, cabin crew managers and Head Office staff reporting to the leadership team. Around half of
        these
        users would be
        accessing the site only on mobile devices as they were not office-based. I tailored pages to each user group,
        with
        simple
        score-based views for the on-the-ground users who needed to be able to quickly identify their performance
        against
        their targets and see how their individual team members were performing. The Head Office and management level
        views
        were more complex, showing more detailed analytics and including the
        functionality for those users to see a high level overview with the option to drill down further into the data
        (for
        example
        by filtering the results) and to create/save
        reports.</p>

      <p>I created mockups and wireframes for both mobile and desktop, and sought feedback from the relevant
        stakeholders on
        both sets before creating the final prototypes using Sketch and InVision. I followed Agile best practices when
        building the front-end of the site.</p>

      <h2 class="tab-heading">Dashboard project for a client in the Banking sector</h2>
      <p>I designed a mobile-friendly site to be used by a banking client to monitor its performance against its KPIs
        in
        relation to customer satisfaction and the customer journey. A key part of the design was a league table style
        regional rankings page, showing the top performing regions by customer satisfaction score, with the option to
        view
        details of best practices followed in those regions to drive improvement across the whole business. I designed
        this
        site using Photoshop and used InVision for the clickable prototype.</p>
